# smyl-api

## History
Early draft versions of the API are originally written using Swagger Editor  https://editor.swagger.io  and then server code generated for a node.js server.

The actual database schema has evolved separately and the API will need to be brought inline with the latest database schema.

## Staging Environment

Is hosted on Azure (for the moment, we may look to change hosting provider depending on available features and pricing).
Continuous integration from github is currently *NOT* enabled.
